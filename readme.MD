## Reproduction of Alberto Cairo's Data Visualization course in R

These are my notes from Alberto Cairo's course. Instead of using iNZight or Flourish to visualize data, I used R and its libraries (tidyverse, ggplot2, sf and more).

Files are organized using module number (m1, m2, etc) and step of the course. Check [full course here](https://journalismcourses.org/data-viz-course-material.html).
